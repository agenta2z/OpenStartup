# Sphinx Warning Triage — Subtask 2 Consolidated Deliverable

**Subtask:** Triage every warning emitted by the warm-build log produced
by subtask 1, fix what is in-scope, suppress what is out-of-scope via
targeted `nitpick_ignore` (with citations), escalate what is neither,
and produce a per-warning triage report.

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Repo root:** `C:\Users\yxinl\OneDrive\Projects\PythonProjects\CoreProjects\OpenStartup`
**Docset:** `responsible-ai-api` (under `docs/source/`)

**Status of work:** **Complete on disk and reconciled.** All steps
(a)–(g) of the user request have already landed; this consolidated
deliverable is the canonical audit-ready record built from two parallel
sub-flow outputs (`sphinx_warning_triage_subtask2_report.md` —
hereafter Flow A, 723 lines; `sphinx_warning_triage_subtask2_deliverable.md` —
hereafter Flow B, 979 lines), reconciled against the on-disk artifacts.

> **Why this file exists.** Two parallel subtask-2 reports were
> produced. They agree on the headline metrics (81 → 6 warnings; −75
> delta; 1 in-scope fix; 9 `nitpick_ignore` entries; 6 escalations) but
> diverge on three factual details that have been re-verified against
> disk in §0.2 below. This document is the single audit-ready
> deliverable: Flow A's correct numerics + Flow B's user-request-aligned
> structure (steps (a)–(g)) + the suppression-lifetime / risk-rollback /
> exit-criteria sections that only Flow B provided. It supersedes both
> upstream files as the canonical subtask-2 record while preserving them
> by path reference for the longer narrative they each carry.

## 0. TL;DR (one screen)

### 0.1 Headline metrics

| Metric | Pre-fix (warm) | Post-fix | Delta |
|--------|--------:|---------:|------:|
| docutils ERRORs | 1 | 1 | 0 (escalated; foundation page) |
| `[toc.not_readable]` WARNINGs | 5 | 5 | 0 (escalated; missing foundation pages) |
| `[ref.dir]` WARNINGs | 1 | 0 | **−1** (fixed in `glossary.rst:13`) |
| `[ref.ref]` WARNINGs | 74 | 0 | **−74** (suppressed via 9 `nitpick_ignore` entries) |
| **Total** | **81** | **6** | **−75** |
| Sphinx summary line | `build succeeded, 81 warnings.` | `build succeeded, 6 warnings.` | |
| Build exit code | 0 | 0 | unchanged |

**The actual unblocker:** `−74` of the `−75` came from the
`('std:label', X) → ('std:ref', X)` rewrite of the 9 `nitpick_ignore`
entries. The `std:label` form is a silent no-op against the `[ref.ref]`
warnings Sphinx 8.2 emits because the suppression key is built as
`f'{domain.name}:{typ}'` from the citation-site role (`ref`), not the
target object type (`label`). The remaining `−1` came from rewriting
the `:rst:dir:` self-reference at `glossary.rst:13` to literal text.
See §6 for the matching-rule derivation; see §4.1 for the conf.py
edits.

### 0.2 Cross-flow factual reconciliation

Three quantitative claims diverged between Flow A and Flow B. All were
re-verified against on-disk artifacts; Flow A is correct on all three.

| Claim | Flow A | Flow B | Verified on disk | Resolution |
|-------|-------:|-------:|------------------|------------|
| `architecture` per-anchor cite count | 21 | 20 | `grep -c "undefined label: 'architecture'" docs/build/build-log-warm.txt` → **21** | Adopt 21 |
| `svc-moderation` per-anchor cite count | 11 | 9 | `grep -c "undefined label: 'svc-moderation'" docs/build/build-log-warm.txt` → **11** | Adopt 11 |
| Per-anchor sub-total | 74 | 69 + "5-line gap" | sum of nine `grep -c` calls = **74** directly | Adopt Flow A; the "gap" is fabricated rationalisation |
| Post-fix log size | 37 lines, ~3,080 bytes | 47 lines, 3,050 bytes | `wc -l docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt` → **37**; `ls -la …` → **3,080** | Adopt Flow A |
| Post-fix line of ERROR | (not specified) | "Line 15" | `head -10 docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt` shows ERROR on **line 10** | Adopt **line 10** |
| Post-fix line of `build succeeded, 6 warnings.` | (not specified) | "Line 45" | `grep -n "build succeeded" …` → **line 35** | Adopt **line 35** |

The Flow B errors do not change any structural conclusion (suppression
strategy, escalation set, constraint compliance). They affect only the
per-anchor distribution table and post-fix-log line citations and have
been corrected throughout this document.

### 0.3 Edits applied (NEW files only — constraint (i) honoured)

* `docs/source/conf.py` — added `nitpick_ignore` block at lines
  94–129 plus a 26-line block-header comment at lines 54–93 that
  explains the matching rule and the suppression-lifetime contract.
  **On disk; verified.**
* `docs/source/glossary.rst:13` — rewrote the `:rst:dir:` cross-reference
  to literal-text `` ``.. glossary::`` ``. **On disk; verified.**
* `docs/source/index.rst` — **no edit.** Toctree intact; 5 `[toc.not_readable]`
  warnings are escalated, not silenced.
* Foundation pages (`configuration.rst`, `inference-models.rst`,
  `operations.rst`) — **untouched** per constraint (i); verified by
  mtime audit.

### 0.4 The 6 surviving warnings — intentional escalations

* 1 docutils ERROR at `configuration.rst:254`
  (`Unknown target name: "startup-time validation".`) — RST anchored-name
  bug on a foundation page; foundation-edit subtask owns the fix.
* 5 `[toc.not_readable]` WARNINGs at `index.rst:22` for the 5 missing
  foundation pages (`introduction`, `getting-started`, `architecture`,
  `service-layer`, `api-reference`) — foundation-author subtask owns
  the resolution.

Both escalations satisfy constraint (iii) ("escalate, do not silence")
and have named owners with self-clearing conditions in §7.

## 1. Inputs, scope, and the rules

### 1.1 On-disk inputs

| Path | Role | Edit-permission |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `docs/build/build-log-warm.txt` (122 lines, 81 warnings) | Warm-build log; the parse target | Read-only |
| `docs/source/conf.py` | NEW file (in-scope) | Editable |
| `docs/source/index.rst` | NEW file (in-scope) | Editable |
| `docs/source/glossary.rst` | NEW file (in-scope) | Editable |
| `docs/source/configuration.rst` | Foundation page — **DO NOT MODIFY** | Read-only |
| `docs/source/inference-models.rst` | Foundation page — **DO NOT MODIFY** | Read-only |
| `docs/source/operations.rst` | Foundation page — **DO NOT MODIFY** | Read-only |
| `docs/source/{introduction,getting-started,architecture,service-layer,api-reference}.rst` | Foundation pages — **NOT ON DISK** | n/a (out-of-scope to author here) |

The eight foundation pages named by constraint (i) are: `introduction`,
`getting-started`, `architecture`, `service-layer`, `inference-models`,
`configuration`, `api-reference`, `operations`. Three exist on disk
(`configuration`, `inference-models`, `operations`); five do not.

### 1.2 The three CRITICAL constraints (verbatim from the user request)

* **(i)** Never modify any of the eight foundation pages.
* **(ii)** Do not weaken `nitpicky=True` to mass-suppress; use
  targeted `nitpick_ignore` entries with one-line citation comments.
* **(iii)** Escalate (do not silence) when suppression is unacceptable.

Compliance evidence is consolidated in §8 ("Compliance with CRITICAL
constraints").

### 1.3 The categorisation buckets

The four request-defined buckets plus two extension buckets that the
warm log forces. The extension buckets are not new policy — both flows
arrived at the same disposition rules independently.

| Bucket | Definition | Required action |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **REAL-BUG** | RST syntax error, broken intra-page ref, duplicate-anchor collision, etc. | Fix-in-place if origin is `conf.py` / `index.rst` / `glossary.rst`; **escalate** if origin is a foundation page. |
| **EXPECTED-NOW-RESOLVED** | Forward `:ref:` anchors made resolvable by a prior subtask. | Should be **zero**; listed only to confirm the anchor chain. |
| **DRIFT** | Anchor-name mismatch between producer and consumer. | Fix in NEW file only; escalate if consumer is in foundation. |
| **PRE-EXISTING-IN-FOUNDATION** | Warning originating in one of the eight already-authored prose pages. | Document but do **not** modify the page; suppress via `nitpick_ignore` with citation. |
| **PRE-EXISTING-IN-NEW-FILE** *(extension)* | `[ref.ref]` in `glossary.rst` whose target is one of the same forward-referenced anchors. | Same suppression as foundation — anchor namespace is shared, not file-scoped. |
| **TOCTREE-PRECONDITION-GAP** *(extension)* | `[toc.not_readable]` in `index.rst` for a missing prerequisite document. | Escalate. `nitpick_ignore` does not match this domain; only `suppress_warnings = ['toc.not_readable']` would silence — that is mass-suppression, forbidden by (ii). |

---

## 2. Step (a) — Parse the warm-build log

Source: `docs/build/build-log-warm.txt` (122 lines, ANSI-stripped, exit
0, `build succeeded, 81 warnings.`). Generated by subtask 1 with
Sphinx 8.2.3, docutils 0.21.2, sphinx_rtd_theme 3.0.2, miniforge3
Python 3.12.7.

### 2.1 Inventory by source file

| Source file | `[docutils]` ERROR | `[toc.not_readable]` | `[ref.dir]` | `[ref.ref]` | **Total** |
|-------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `index.rst` (NEW) | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | **5** |
| `configuration.rst` (foundation) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 43 | **44** |
| `glossary.rst` (NEW) | 0 | 0 | 1 | 19 | **20** |
| `inference-models.rst` (foundation) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7 | **7** |
| `operations.rst` (foundation) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | **5** |
| **Total** | **1** | **5** | **1** | **74** | **81** |

### 2.2 Inventory by unique cross-reference target — corrected

The 74 `[ref.ref]` warnings collapse to **9 unique anchor names**.
Counts below are verified on disk via per-anchor `grep -c` against
the warm log (see §0.2).

| Anchor | Cite count | Producer page (expected) | Consumer pages |
|--------|-----------:|--------------------------|----------------|
| `architecture` | **21** | `architecture.rst` (not on disk) | configuration, glossary, inference-models, operations |
| `api-reference` | **16** | `api-reference.rst` (not on disk) | configuration, glossary |
| `getting-started` | **11** | `getting-started.rst` (not on disk) | configuration, glossary, operations |
| `svc-moderation` | **11** | `service-layer.rst` (not on disk; sub-anchor) | configuration, glossary, inference-models |
| `introduction` | **5** | `introduction.rst` (not on disk) | configuration, glossary |
| `api-etag` | **4** | `api-reference.rst` sub-anchor | configuration, glossary |
| `arch-debug-trace` | **2** | `architecture.rst` sub-anchor | glossary |
| `api-debug-trace` | **2** | `api-reference.rst` sub-anchor | glossary |
| `gs-feature-flags` | **2** | `getting-started.rst` sub-anchor | configuration, glossary |
| **Total cites** | **74** | (5 missing pages) | (4 cite-side pages) |

The per-anchor counts sum directly to 74; the "5-line gap" Flow B
narrative is not real (see §0.2).

### 2.3 The 7 non-`[ref.ref]` lines (verbatim shape from warm log)

* `configuration.rst:254: ERROR: Unknown target name: "startup-time validation". [docutils]`
* `index.rst:22: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'introduction' [toc.not_readable]`
* `index.rst:22: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'getting-started' [toc.not_readable]`
* `index.rst:22: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'architecture' [toc.not_readable]`
* `index.rst:22: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'service-layer' [toc.not_readable]`
* `index.rst:22: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'api-reference' [toc.not_readable]`
* `glossary.rst:13: WARNING: rst:dir reference target not found: glossary [ref.dir]`

These 7 drive the entire REAL-BUG / DRIFT / escalation decision tree.
The remaining 74 are the forward-reference `[ref.ref]` lines.

### 2.4 Full per-warning detail table (referenced, not reproduced)

The 81-row per-warning detail table, sorted by source/line, with bucket
and action columns, is preserved at:

* `docs/_plan/sphinx_warning_triage_subtask2_report.md` (Flow A) —
  §2.3, lines 198–290 of that file. Each row carries `(#, Source, Line,
  Sev, Tag, Target, Bucket, Action)` and is the single audit-ready
  enumeration.

This consolidated document does **not** reproduce that table because
(a) it is on disk in the upstream artifact and (b) the row data is
exhaustive and reproducible from the warm log via `awk`/`grep`. Per-row
spot checks are in §0.2 and the audit trail in §10.

---

## 3. Step (b) — Per-warning categorisation

### 3.1 Bucket summary

| Bucket | Count | Action taken | Verified by |
|--------|------:|--------------|-------------|
| EXPECTED-NOW-RESOLVED | **0** | None — no upstream subtask landed any of the 5 missing pages | Disk audit (see §3.2) |
| REAL-BUG, **fixable** in NEW file | **1** | `glossary.rst:13` — replaced `:rst:dir:` self-reference with literal `` ``.. glossary::`` `` text | Post-fix log: 0 `[ref.dir]` warnings (was 1) |
| REAL-BUG, **escalated** (foundation) | **1** | `configuration.rst:254` docutils ERROR `Unknown target name: "Startup-time validation"` — left as-is, flagged in §7 | Post-fix log: still 1 docutils ERROR |
| DRIFT (anchor-name mismatch) | **0** | None — every undefined-label warning is a *missing-page* problem, not a *misnamed-anchor* problem | Glossary's "Shared Anchor Map" registry shows producer/consumer spellings agree for all 9 anchors |
| PRE-EXISTING-IN-FOUNDATION (`[ref.ref]` in foundation) | **55** | Suppressed via 9-entry `nitpick_ignore` block | Post-fix log: 0 `[ref.ref]` warnings (was 55 from foundation) |
| PRE-EXISTING-IN-NEW-FILE (`[ref.ref]` in `glossary.rst`) | **19** | Suppressed via the **same 9 entries** — anchor namespace is shared | Post-fix log: 0 `[ref.ref]` warnings (was 19 from `glossary.rst`) |
| TOCTREE-PRECONDITION-GAP (`[toc.not_readable]` in `index.rst`) | **5** | Escalated; pruning would mask the gap; blanket `suppress_warnings` violates (ii) | Post-fix log: still 5 `[toc.not_readable]` (intentional residual) |
| **Total** | **81** | | |

The 55 + 19 split of `[ref.ref]` warnings reconciles with the per-source
totals in §2.1: 43 (configuration) + 7 (inference-models) + 5 (operations)
= 55 from foundation; 19 from glossary = 74 total. Both flows agree on
this split.

### 3.2 EXPECTED-NOW-RESOLVED bucket — verification it is empty

Procedure: enumerate the 9 unique forward-referenced anchor names from
§2.2; for each, grep `docs/source/*.rst` for an `.. _<anchor>:`
definition; bucket as RESOLVED if found, UNRESOLVED if not.

| Anchor | Grep target | Found? | Bucket |
|--------|-------------|-------:|--------|
| `introduction` | `^\.\. _introduction:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `getting-started` | `^\.\. _getting-started:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `gs-feature-flags` | `^\.\. _gs-feature-flags:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `architecture` | `^\.\. _architecture:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `arch-debug-trace` | `^\.\. _arch-debug-trace:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `svc-moderation` | `^\.\. _svc-moderation:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `api-reference` | `^\.\. _api-reference:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `api-etag` | `^\.\. _api-etag:` | No | UNRESOLVED |
| `api-debug-trace` | `^\.\. _api-debug-trace:` | No | UNRESOLVED |

**0 anchors resolved → EXPECTED-NOW-RESOLVED bucket is empty.** This
is the negative-finding signal that the anchor chain is sound: the
unresolved labels are unresolved because the *page* is missing, not
because a prior subtask landed a page with a different anchor name.

If even one anchor here were RESOLVED, that would be the cue to delete
the corresponding `nitpick_ignore` line (per the lifetime contract in
§4.2). That condition does not yet hold.

### 3.3 DRIFT bucket — verification it is empty

For DRIFT to apply, an anchor name *cited* (`:ref:`<X>``) would have
to differ from the *intended* anchor name on the producer page. Since
none of the 5 producer pages exist yet, there is no producer-side
spelling to drift from. The 4 producer pages that *do* exist
(`configuration`, `inference-models`, `operations`, `glossary`) have
their own page-top anchors (`config-overview`, `inf-models`,
`infra-overview`/`ops-overview`, `glossary`), all of which resolve
cleanly in both the warm and post-fix logs (no warning fires against
any of them).

Every undefined-label warning maps to one of the 9 anchor names
documented in `glossary.rst`'s "Shared Anchor Map" registry as the
*planned* names for the 5 missing pages. The bucket is correctly
empty.

---

## 4. Steps (c) and (d) — Concrete edits applied in NEW files

### 4.1 `docs/source/conf.py` — 9-entry `nitpick_ignore` block

This is the high-value edit: −74 of the −75 warning delta comes from
this block. The block lives at `conf.py:94–129`, with a block-header
comment at `conf.py:54–93` that explains the matching rule and the
suppression-lifetime contract.

**Form of each entry:** `('std:ref', '<anchor>')` — the **role** form
(`std:ref`), not the object form (`std:label`). See §6 for the
correctness rationale; an earlier revision used `std:label` and that
was the silent no-op that left all 74 `[ref.ref]` warnings firing.

**Entries added** (preserved as a self-documenting registry; the full
verbatim block is on disk at `conf.py:94–129`):

| # | Anchor | Citation comment summary |
|--:|--------|--------------------------|
| 1 | `introduction` | introduction.rst page-top; cited at configuration.rst:9, 2052, 2111 and glossary.rst:220, 619 |
| 2 | `getting-started` | getting-started.rst page-top; cited 11× across configuration, operations, glossary |
| 3 | `gs-feature-flags` | getting-started.rst sub-anchor; cited from configuration.rst:2054 and glossary.rst:620 |
| 4 | `architecture` | architecture.rst — most-cited forward anchor (21 cites); appears in every existing page plus glossary |
| 5 | `arch-debug-trace` | architecture.rst sub-anchor for the debug-trace handler chain; required by glossary.rst:76, 624, 638 |
| 6 | `svc-moderation` | service-layer.rst sub-anchor; cited 11× from configuration, inference-models, glossary |
| 7 | `api-reference` | api-reference.rst page-top; cited 16× across configuration, glossary |
| 8 | `api-etag` | api-reference.rst sub-anchor; cited from configuration.rst:1068, 2066 and glossary.rst:89, 638 |
| 9 | `api-debug-trace` | api-reference.rst sub-anchor; required by glossary.rst:76, 638 |

The `service-layer` page-top anchor itself is **not** listed because
nothing currently `:ref:`-cites it (only its sub-anchor `svc-moderation`
is cited). When `service-layer.rst` lands and someone adds a
`:ref:`service-layer`` cite, an entry will need to be added — but that
is the correct workflow: a missing entry surfaces an honest warning
that someone should pair with an anchor-map registration.

**Header preamble** (verbatim location: `conf.py:54–93`) explains why
suppression is appropriate, why each entry is a forward-reference (not
a typo), why the tuple key is `('std:ref', …)`, and what conditions
should cause an entry to be **deleted** (= the corresponding page
landing). This satisfies constraint (ii) — every suppression carries
a citation, and the suppression is targeted (one anchor per entry),
not blanket.

### 4.2 Suppression-lifetime contract — entry-to-page mapping

Each `nitpick_ignore` entry is **tied to one foundation page**. When
that page lands on disk with the corresponding `.. _<anchor>:`
directive, the entry **must be removed in the same commit**.

| Entry | Page that should host the anchor | Removal trigger |
|-------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| `('std:ref', 'introduction')` | `introduction.rst` | `.. _introduction:` lands at the top of the page |
| `('std:ref', 'getting-started')` | `getting-started.rst` | `.. _getting-started:` lands |
| `('std:ref', 'gs-feature-flags')` | `getting-started.rst` (sub-anchor) | `.. _gs-feature-flags:` lands inside the page |
| `('std:ref', 'architecture')` | `architecture.rst` | `.. _architecture:` lands |
| `('std:ref', 'arch-debug-trace')` | `architecture.rst` (sub-anchor) | `.. _arch-debug-trace:` lands |
| `('std:ref', 'svc-moderation')` | `service-layer.rst` (sub-anchor) | `.. _svc-moderation:` lands |
| `('std:ref', 'api-reference')` | `api-reference.rst` | `.. _api-reference:` lands |
| `('std:ref', 'api-etag')` | `api-reference.rst` (sub-anchor) | `.. _api-etag:` lands |
| `('std:ref', 'api-debug-trace')` | `api-reference.rst` (sub-anchor) | `.. _api-debug-trace:` lands |

**Why removal-in-the-same-commit matters.** If the foundation-page
author lands `introduction.rst` *without* removing
`('std:ref', 'introduction')`, then a later typo'd `:ref:`introducton``
(missing `i`) would resolve to "warning suppressed" rather than
"warning fired" — silently swallowing the regression. The
`conf.py:69–79` block-header comment names this exact failure mode and
instructs the next author accordingly.

### 4.3 `docs/source/glossary.rst:13` — `:rst:dir:` self-reference removed

**Before** (warm log line):

```
glossary.rst:13: WARNING: 'rst:dir' reference target not found: glossary [ref.dir]
```

The line at `glossary.rst:13` invoked `:rst:dir:`glossary`` as a
cross-reference role. The rst-domain inventory does not contain a
directive named `glossary` registered as a referenceable target (the
`glossary` directive ships with Sphinx itself, but the `:rst:dir:`
role does not auto-resolve to it unless a corresponding inventory is
loaded). The intent of the prose was to **name** the directive, not
**cross-reference** it.

**After** (verified on disk via `Read glossary.rst:13`):

```rst
   * The ``.. glossary::`` directive below — alphabetised — for
```

The directive name is now in literal-text double-backticks. Suppression
via `('rst:dir', 'glossary')` was technically possible but the
source-side fix is preferred per the user request: REAL-BUGs in
editable files should be fixed in place, not suppressed.

**Verification:** `grep -n 'rst:dir|:rst:dir:' docs/source/glossary.rst`
returns no matches; post-fix log emits 0 `[ref.dir]` warnings.

### 4.4 `docs/source/index.rst` — *no edit*

The 5 `[toc.not_readable]` warnings on `index.rst:22` name the 5
not-yet-authored prerequisite pages. Three options were considered:

| Option | Action | Verdict |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Prune the toctree | Remove the 5 missing entries from `index.rst:22` | **Rejected** — masks the gap; no signal to subsequent subtasks |
| Comment out per-entry | Wrap each missing page in `..` comment | **Rejected** — same masking effect; harder to un-comment cleanly |
| Leave as-is | Accept 5 residual `[toc.not_readable]` warnings | **Adopted** — preserves the manifest, provides per-build progress signal |

`index.rst` is therefore unchanged. The 5 residual warnings are
escalated in §7 with the recommendation that the authoring subtask for
each missing page lands the file (which auto-clears the corresponding
warning).

### 4.5 Foundation pages — *no edits*

Per constraint (i), `inference-models.rst`, `configuration.rst`, and
`operations.rst` are out of scope. The 55 `[ref.ref]` warnings
originating in them are suppressed via `nitpick_ignore` (above); the
1 docutils ERROR in `configuration.rst:254` is escalated (§7.1).
`introduction.rst`, `getting-started.rst`, `architecture.rst`,
`service-layer.rst`, `api-reference.rst` are not on disk — there is
nothing to edit.

Foundation-untouched verification (mtime audit): `configuration.rst`
(May 4 09:49), `inference-models.rst` (May 4 09:18), `operations.rst`
(May 4 09:59) are all *older* than the post-fix build log and the
`conf.py`/`glossary.rst` edits (May 4 10:43 / 10:41).

---

## 5. Steps (e) and (f) — Rebuild and post-fix log

### 5.1 Tooling note: `uv run sphinx-build` substitution

The user request prescribes:

```bash
rm -rf docs/build/html
uv run sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build/html
```

`uv` is **not on PATH** in this environment (verified via
`command -v uv` → not found; consistent with subtask 1's environment
audit). The active interpreter is miniforge3 Python 3.12.7, which has
the required toolchain importable:

```
sphinx 8.2.3        # required: 8.x
docutils 0.21.2     # required: >= 0.20
sphinx_rtd_theme 3.0.2
```

**Substitute used** (bash; the actual command that produced
`docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt`):

```bash
rm -rf docs/build/html
python -m sphinx -b html --no-color docs/source docs/build/html \
    > docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt 2>&1
echo "exit: $?"
```

This is a **toolchain** substitution, not a **behaviour**
substitution: same Sphinx 8.2.3 binary, same source tree, same
`nitpicky=True` flag. `--no-color` suppresses ANSI escapes that would
otherwise embed in the redirected log; the upstream warm log was
similarly ANSI-stripped. Empirically the substitution validates: warm
runs produce 81 warnings, post-fix runs produce 6 warnings — both
counts match the upstream-flow predictions.

**Cross-platform note** (Flow B contribution; relevant for executors
running on Windows): on PowerShell 5.1,

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force docs\build\html
python -m sphinx -b html docs\source docs\build\html `
    > docs\build\build-log-after-fix.txt 2>&1
"sphinx-build exit=$LASTEXITCODE"
```

— use `$LASTEXITCODE`, not `$?`, to read native-exe exit status. Avoid
`2>&1` on a native exe through a PS 5.1 pipeline: it wraps each stderr
line in an `ErrorRecord` and flips `$?` to `$false` even when the exe
returned 0. The bash `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` form (used inside a `| tee`
pipeline) is the equivalent recovery mechanism on Linux/macOS.

If/when `uv` lands on PATH (e.g., after `pipx install uv`), the
prescribed `uv run sphinx-build` form should be used verbatim — no
behavioural difference is expected.

### 5.2 Validation criteria (predicted-vs-observed)

| Predicted | Observed (in `docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt`) | Match? |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|:-:|
| `[ref.ref]` drops to 0 after `('std:ref', X)` rewrite | 0 | ✓ |
| `[ref.dir]` drops to 0 after `glossary.rst:13` fix | 0 | ✓ |
| `[toc.not_readable]` unchanged at 5 | 5 | ✓ |
| docutils ERROR unchanged at 1 | 1 | ✓ |
| Final summary `build succeeded, 6 warnings.` | line 35 reads exactly that | ✓ |
| Build exit code 0 | 0 | ✓ |

All 6 predictions land. No surprise residuals, no new warning class
appeared post-fix, and no warning the triage *intended* to suppress
survived.

### 5.3 Post-fix log location and content summary

**Path:** `docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt` (37 lines, ~3,080 bytes,
ANSI-stripped, regenerated this turn from a clean rebuild).

**Content map** (corrected line numbers vs Flow B):

* Lines 1–9 — Sphinx startup, source-suffix conversion, environment
  setup, source reading (5 files: configuration, glossary, index,
  inference-models, operations).
* **Line 10** — `configuration.rst:254: ERROR: Unknown target name: "startup-time validation". [docutils]` (escalated; foundation page; see §7.1).
* **Lines 11–15** — 5 `[toc.not_readable]` warnings against
  `index.rst:22` for the 5 missing foundation pages, in this order:
  `introduction`, `getting-started`, `architecture`, `service-layer`,
  `api-reference`. (Escalated; see §7.2.)
* Lines 16–34 — environment pickling, copying assets, writing output,
  generating indices, writing search index, dumping object inventory.
* **Line 35** — `build succeeded, 6 warnings.`
* Lines 36–37 — trailer (`The HTML pages are in docs\build\html.`).

The 6 surviving warnings exactly match the escalation set in §7.

### 5.4 Delta breakdown

| Tag | Warm | Post-fix | Delta | How the delta was achieved |
|-----|-----:|---------:|------:|----------------------------|
| docutils ERROR | 1 | 1 | 0 | Escalated (foundation page; cannot edit per (i)) |
| `[toc.not_readable]` | 5 | 5 | 0 | Escalated (5 prerequisite pages still unauthored) |
| `[ref.dir]` | 1 | 0 | **−1** | Fixed in `glossary.rst:13` (§4.3) |
| `[ref.ref]` | 74 | 0 | **−74** | Suppressed via 9-entry `nitpick_ignore` block (§4.1) |
| **Total** | **81** | **6** | **−75** | |

## 6. The matching-rule derivation (`std:label` vs `std:ref`)

This section preserves the load-bearing piece of analysis from the
prior triage iterations so it is not lost. **It also exists to prevent
re-introduction of the silent-no-op bug.** A future maintainer might
"correct" `('std:ref', X)` back to `('std:label', X)` because the
`label` form *looks* more semantically right (the target *is* a label
created by an `.. _<anchor>:` directive). It is not.

### 6.1 The Sphinx code path

Sphinx's `ReferencesResolver.warn_missing_reference` (in
`sphinx/transforms/post_transforms/__init__.py`) builds the suppression
key as:

```python
dtype = f'{domain.name}:{typ}'
```

…and then checks whether `(dtype, target)` is in
`config.nitpick_ignore`.

**Critical detail:** `typ` is the **cross-reference role used at the
citation site**, not the **target object type** the role would have
resolved to. For a `:ref:`<name>`` invocation that fails to resolve:

* `domain.name` = `'std'` (the standard domain owns the `:ref:` role)
* `typ` = `'ref'` (the role used at the citation, *not* `'label'`,
  even though the target object is a label)

So the key is `'std:ref'`, and the only matching `nitpick_ignore`
entry is `('std:ref', '<name>')`.

### 6.2 Why `('std:label', X)` does nothing

`('std:label', '<name>')` builds key `'std:label'` which is **never
compared against** for `[ref.ref]` warnings — that string would only
match if some role *named* `:label:` were used at the citation site.
No such role exists in core Sphinx. Hence the entry parses without
error, the build "succeeds", and the warnings continue to fire. The
trap is that everything *looks* right at scan time.

### 6.3 Empirical evidence (the −74 driver)

From the prior triage iteration that landed the fix on disk:
rebuilding with `('std:label', X)` entries leaves all 74 `[ref.ref]`
warnings emitted; rewriting them as `('std:ref', X)` drops them all to
0. This single key-form rewrite is the −74 driver of the −75 total
delta. The `glossary.rst:13` fix accounts for the remaining −1.

### 6.4 What the on-disk `conf.py` block-header comment does about this

The `conf.py:81–93` block-header comment explicitly names the matching
rule:

> The tuple form is `('std:ref', '<anchor>')` — i.e. the cross-reference
> *type* (`std:ref`, the role used to cite the anchor), not the
> *object* type (`std:label`, the anchor that the role would have
> resolved to). This matches the `f'{domain.name}:{typ}'` key that
> `ReferencesResolver.warn_missing_reference` builds at warning time
> (`sphinx/transforms/post_transforms/__init__.py`); using `std:label`
> silently fails to suppress and leaves every warning intact.

A future maintainer reading this comment before changing the keys
will not re-introduce the bug. The on-disk evidence chain
(`build-log-warm.txt: 81 warnings` with the original `std:label` form
→ `build-log-after-fix.txt: 6 warnings` after the rewrite to
`std:ref`) is the empirical proof.

---

## 7. Open escalations (constraint (iii) compliance)

The triage explicitly **does not** silence the items below. Each is
flagged for follow-up rather than buried, with a named owner and a
self-clearing condition.

### 7.1 `configuration.rst:254` docutils `Unknown target name` ERROR

**Warm-log line:**

```
configuration.rst:254: ERROR: Unknown target name: "startup-time validation". [docutils]
```

**Source context** (`configuration.rst:250–260`):

```rst
       ``"localhost":"50050"``. ``TenantContextClient`` reads this
       once at construction (see `Tenant context (TCS)`_).
   * - ``asap_signer``
     - ``ASAP_ISSUER`` + ``ASAP_PRIVATE_KEY``
     - **Validated at startup** — see `Startup-time validation`_
       below. In local mode with ``NO_ASAP_SIGNER=true`` it is set to
       a ``unittest.mock.Mock(JWTAuthSigner)``.
```

The line uses an anonymous-named docutils reference target — the
backtick-quoted phrase followed by an underscore. Docutils requires
this to match either an explicit `.. _startup-time validation:`
directive or a section heading literally titled "Startup-time
validation". The closest existing candidates in the file:

* Line 322: section heading `Startup-time vs runtime mutability`
  (close but not equal)
* Line 330: prose `Two settings have *startup-time validation*:`
  (in body, not a heading; cannot be the target)

**Recommended one-line fix** (for the foundation-edit subtask that
owns `configuration.rst`):

```rst
.. _startup-time validation:

Startup-time vs runtime mutability
----------------------------------
```

inserted at line 322 (immediately above the existing heading).
Alternatively, retitle the heading to `Startup-time validation`. Either
resolves the ERROR with no other collateral. **Constraint (i) prevents
applying this fix in subtask 2.**

**Why not suppress?** The docutils ERROR is *intra-page* — producer
and consumer both live in `configuration.rst`. There is no
`nitpick_ignore` shape that suppresses inline-reference docutils
ERRORs (the entries match `(domain, target)` for std-domain `:ref:`
warnings only; the `[docutils]` warning class is emitted by docutils
itself before Sphinx's nitpick layer runs). Constraint (iii) applies:
**escalation is the only acceptable action.**

**Note on root-cause framing.** Flow B characterised the bug as a
"hyphenation typo" (author meant `startup-time-validation` but typed
spaces), implying the fix is a single character change in the
*citation*. Flow A characterised it as a *missing-target* problem and
recommended adding the explicit anchor near the existing heading.
**Both fixes work**; the foundation-edit subtask should apply whichever
matches the actual authoring intent, but the citation-side hyphenation
fix is *also* an acceptable resolution if the spaced form was
unintentional.

### 7.2 `index.rst:22` — 5× `[toc.not_readable]` for missing prerequisite pages

The 5 missing documents (`introduction`, `getting-started`,
`architecture`, `service-layer`, `api-reference`) are
**prerequisites**, not optional sections. The toctree in `index.rst`
encodes the read-end-to-end manifest of the docset; pruning would mask
the gap and break the read-once narrative. Suppressing
`toc.not_readable` would require a blanket `suppress_warnings` entry
that violates constraint (ii).

**Disposition:** flag for the foundation-author subtask. When each
missing page is authored and lands under `docs/source/`, the
corresponding `[toc.not_readable]` warning auto-clears without any
further `index.rst` edit. **Each landing also mandates removal of one
or more `nitpick_ignore` entries in the same commit** (per §4.2).

### 7.3 Why the residual 6 are an *acceptable* end state

The post-fix log shows `build succeeded, 6 warnings.` — non-zero, but
deliberately so:

* All 6 residuals are **escalation flags** signalling an upstream
  authoring gap, not a regression.
* All 6 residuals **self-clear** when the upstream gap closes (1
  docutils ERROR clears when `configuration.rst:254` gets a real
  target; 5 toctree warnings clear when the 5 pages are authored).
* Suppressing them would silently swallow the same authoring gap on
  every future build — exactly the regression that constraints (ii)
  and (iii) are designed to prevent.

This satisfies the request's "(or explicitly-triaged)" carve-out: a
clean **or explicitly-triaged** end state is the success criterion;
the 6 residuals are explicitly triaged here.

---

## 8. Compliance with the request's CRITICAL constraints

| Constraint | Honoured? | Evidence |
|------------|:---------:|----------|
| (i) Never modify the 8 foundation pages | ✓ | Only `conf.py` and `glossary.rst:13` edited. The 3 on-disk foundation pages (`configuration.rst`, `inference-models.rst`, `operations.rst`) are byte-unchanged (mtime audit in §4.5). The 5 not-on-disk foundation pages were not authored here. |
| (ii) Do not weaken `nitpicky=True`; use targeted `nitpick_ignore` with citations | ✓ | `conf.py:52` retains `nitpicky = True`; the 9 `nitpick_ignore` entries are each per-anchor (not blanket); each carries a multi-line citation comment naming source pages and reason; no `suppress_warnings = [...]` was added. |
| (iii) Escalate (do not silently edit) when suppression is unacceptable | ✓ | 1 docutils ERROR + 5 toctree warnings escalated in §7 with named owners and recommended fixes. No foundation-page edit performed; no `suppress_warnings` mass-suppression added. |

---

## 9. Step (g) — Handoff and lifetime contracts

### 9.1 What this subtask leaves in place

Touched (NEW files only, per the constraints):

* `docs/source/conf.py` — `nitpick_ignore` block at lines 94–129 plus
  block-header comment at lines 54–93.
* `docs/source/glossary.rst` — line 13 only.

Preserved (foundation pages on disk — never opened for write):

* `docs/source/configuration.rst`
* `docs/source/inference-models.rst`
* `docs/source/operations.rst`

Not present on disk (foundation pages flagged as missing — escalated,
not authored here):

* `docs/source/introduction.rst`
* `docs/source/getting-started.rst`
* `docs/source/architecture.rst`
* `docs/source/service-layer.rst`
* `docs/source/api-reference.rst`

Build artifacts produced:

* `docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt` (37 lines, ~3,080 bytes,
  ANSI-stripped).
* `docs/build/html/` (rebuilt; clean except for the 6 escalated
  warnings).

### 9.2 Handoff items for downstream subtasks

**Foundation-page authoring subtask** (next; owns 5 missing pages):

* Owns the creation of `introduction`, `getting-started`,
  `architecture`, `service-layer`, `api-reference`.
* Each page must include a page-top `.. _<basename>:` anchor (e.g.
  `.. _introduction:` at the top of `introduction.rst`).
* Sub-anchors that are forward-referenced today (`gs-feature-flags`,
  `arch-debug-trace`, `svc-moderation`, `api-etag`,
  `api-debug-trace`) should land in their respective host pages per
  the §4.2 mapping.
* **For every anchor that lands, the matching `nitpick_ignore` entry
  in `conf.py` must be removed in the same commit.** Otherwise typos
  on the now-resolvable anchor would silently slip through.
* Each page-landing should bring the warning count strictly down,
  validating the entry-removal in real time.

**Foundation-page review subtask** (owns the docutils ERROR):

* Owns the `configuration.rst:254` fix. Two equally acceptable
  resolutions are documented in §7.1: (a) add an explicit anchor
  `.. _startup-time validation:` immediately above the line-322
  heading, or (b) hyphenate the citation in line 254
  (`startup-time validation` → `startup-time-validation`) if the
  spaced form was a typo. Apply whichever matches authoring intent.

**Repo-tooling subtask** (if/when one runs):

* If `uv` becomes authoritative, switch `python -m sphinx` calls to
  `uv run sphinx-build` in any committed CI/build scripts. Output is
  identical; only the launcher differs.

### 9.3 Risks and mitigations

* **Risk:** a future page-authoring subtask lands a foundation page
  but forgets to remove the matching `nitpick_ignore` line. A typo'd
  `:ref:`<anchor>`` would then silently slip through — the
  suppression masks the regression.
  **Mitigation:** the inline comment header at `conf.py:69–79` and the
  per-tuple citation comments at `conf.py:94–129` explicitly tell the
  next author: "Removing each entry below is the *signal* that the
  corresponding page authoring subtask has landed." The §4.2
  entry-to-page mapping is the single-screen reference.

* **Risk:** a new foundation-page edit introduces a broken anchor
  that collides with one of the 9 suppressed names.
  **Mitigation:** the `conf.py` block-header comment instructs the
  author to add a new `nitpick_ignore` entry only with a Shared
  Anchor Map row in `glossary.rst:358+` to back it; without the
  anchor-map row, no `nitpick_ignore` line should be added.

* **Risk:** a future maintainer "fixes" the suppression keys back to
  `('std:label', X)` because that string *looks* more semantically
  correct (label = the target object).
  **Mitigation:** the on-disk `conf.py:81–93` block-header comment
  names the matching rule (`f'{domain.name}:{typ}'` from
  `sphinx/transforms/post_transforms/__init__.py`) and explains that
  `typ` is the role used at the citation site, not the object type
  the role would have resolved to. §6 of this document carries the
  same explanation as a backup record.

* **Risk:** rollback of this subtask is needed (e.g., if the conf.py
  edit is found to mask a real bug).
  **Rollback procedure:** revert `conf.py:54–129` and
  `glossary.rst:13`; delete `docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt`. The
  pre-fix state is reproducible from the (preserved) warm-build log
  at `docs/build/build-log-warm.txt`. A clean rebuild after rollback
  yields 81 warnings (the original warm-log count).

### 9.4 Exit criteria

Subtask 2 is complete when:

1. ✓ Post-fix warning count = 6 (verified: `build-log-after-fix.txt:35`
   reads `build succeeded, 6 warnings.`).
2. ✓ The 6 surviving warnings match the escalation set in §7 verbatim
   (verified: `build-log-after-fix.txt:10–15`).
3. ✓ Zero foundation-page edits (verified by mtime in §4.5).
4. ✓ Each `nitpick_ignore` entry has a one-line citation comment
   (verified: `conf.py:94–129`).
5. ✓ `nitpicky=True` is unchanged (verified: `conf.py:52`).
6. ✓ No `suppress_warnings = [...]` line in `conf.py` (verified:
   `grep "suppress_warnings" docs/source/conf.py` → 0 matches).
7. ✓ Per-warning triage report exists (Flow A §2.3, §8 of this
   document).

All seven criteria met as of 2026-05-04.

## 10. Audit trail (verification commands and their outputs)

The following commands were run during preparation of this consolidated
deliverable to verify on-disk state matches every claim above. Outputs
recorded inline.

```bash
# 1. Foundation pages on disk vs missing
ls docs/source/*.rst
# → configuration.rst, glossary.rst, index.rst, inference-models.rst, operations.rst
# → 5 of the 8 foundation files (introduction, getting-started, architecture,
#   service-layer, api-reference are absent)

# 2. Warm-log warning count
grep -c "WARNING\|ERROR" docs/build/build-log-warm.txt   # -> 81
tail -2 docs/build/build-log-warm.txt                    # -> "build succeeded, 81 warnings."

# 3. Post-fix log warning count
grep -c "WARNING\|ERROR" docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt   # -> 6
tail -2 docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt                    # -> "build succeeded, 6 warnings."
wc -l docs/build/build-log-after-fix.txt                      # -> 37 lines

# 4. nitpick_ignore tuple-key correctness on disk
grep "nitpick_ignore\|std:ref\|std:label" docs/source/conf.py
# → 9 lines all matching ('std:ref','<anchor>') — zero std:label survivors

# 5. nitpicky=True is unchanged (constraint (ii))
grep "nitpicky\|suppress_warnings" docs/source/conf.py
# → "nitpicky = True" present; no suppress_warnings line

# 6. glossary.rst:13 fix verification
sed -n "13p" docs/source/glossary.rst
# → "   * The ``.. glossary::`` directive below — alphabetised — for"

# 7. Foundation-page mtime audit (constraint (i))
ls -la docs/source/configuration.rst docs/source/inference-models.rst docs/source/operations.rst
# → all mtimes earlier than the post-fix build (10:44); no edits

# 8. Per-anchor cite-count cross-check (resolves Flow A vs Flow B discrepancy)
for a in architecture api-reference getting-started svc-moderation introduction \

done
# → architecture 21, api-reference 16, getting-started 11, svc-moderation 11,
#   introduction 5, api-etag 4, arch-debug-trace 2, api-debug-trace 2,
#   gs-feature-flags 2. Sum = 74. Matches Flow A; Flow B's 20+9 figures and
#   "5-line gap" narrative are wrong.
```

## 11. Cross-references to predecessor and parallel artifacts

This deliverable is self-contained for audit purposes. The longer
planning/iteration artifacts in `docs/_plan/` carry deeper background
that a downstream maintainer or reviewer may want.

| Artifact | Lines | What it adds beyond this document |
|----------|------:|-----------------------------------|
| `sphinx_warning_triage_subtask2_report.md` (Flow A) | 723 | The 81-row per-warning detail table (§2.3 of that file) — preserved here by reference rather than reproduced. Source of the per-anchor cite counts, predicted-vs-observed reconciliation, and tooling-substitution rationale. |
| `sphinx_warning_triage_subtask2_deliverable.md` (Flow B) | 979 | Verbatim conf.py block content (§4.1 of that file), step-(a)-to-(g) structural alignment, suppression-lifetime contract table, risks/rollback section, exit-criteria checklist, audit trail with verification commands. **Note:** Flow B's per-anchor counts (architecture: 20; svc-moderation: 9) and post-fix-log line citations (line 15 ERROR; line 45 trailer) are factually wrong; the corrected values from Flow A and on-disk re-verification are used throughout this consolidated record. |
| `sphinx_build_capture_plan.md` (subtask 1, flow 0) | ~456 | Predecessor build-capture plan; empirical pre-fix predictions; environment audit (no `uv`, no `pyproject.toml`). |
| `sphinx_initial_build_plan.md` (subtask 1, flow 1) | ~520 | Parallel build-capture plan; second-source verification of environmental constraints; install-path decision matrix (5 options compared); cross-platform tooling pattern (bash `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`, PowerShell `$LASTEXITCODE` caveat) — reproduced in §5.1 above. |
| `sphinx_warning_triage_plan.md` | ~1,453 | Pre-execution planning artifact; full §0–§10 structure; predicted 6 post-fix warnings ahead of time; was the source of the *original* `('std:label', X)` recommendation that the empirical iteration caught and corrected. |
| `sphinx_warning_triage_report.md` | ~816 | End-to-end execution report; source of the empirical `std:label → std:ref` discovery; the on-disk fixes in `conf.py` and `glossary.rst:13` are this flow's edits. |
| `sphinx_warning_triage_consolidated.md` | ~1,214 | Iteration-3 consolidation of the planning + execution flows. Contains the deepest matching-rule derivation, cross-flow agreement matrix, and locator evidence for the original `('std:label', X)` occurrences. |
| `sphinx_warning_triage_plan_consolidated.md` | ~247 | Parallel iteration-2 consolidation; source of the §9.3 risks/rollback section pattern and the entry-to-page mapping pattern. |
| `sphinx_warning_triage_final.md` | ~250 | Earlier "final" consolidated plan-and-report; concise; same conclusions as this document. |
| `sphinx_scaffolding_audit.md` | ~272 | Predecessor page-existence audit — confirmed 3 of 8 foundation pages on disk before subtask 1. |
| `sphinx_subtask1_install_build_capture_plan.md` | ~12,000 chars | Subtask-1 install + build + capture plan (parallel; matches subtask 1 deliverable). |

This deliverable is the canonical subtask-2 record. If a reviewer reads
only one file from this directory to understand the subtask 2 outcome,
this is the file to read. Flow A and Flow B remain on disk; this
document supersedes them as the canonical record but does not delete
them (their per-warning detail tables and verbatim conf.py snippets
remain useful as deeper drill-downs).

---

## 12. End-state declaration

The docset's warning state is now **explicitly triaged**:

* **0** unexplained warnings.
* **0** in-scope-and-fixable warnings outstanding.
* **6** explicitly-escalated warnings, each with a named owner and a
  self-clearing condition (§7).
* **0** foundation-page edits performed (constraint (i) honoured).
* **0** `suppress_warnings` mass-suppressions added (constraint (ii)
  honoured).

Subtask 2 closes here. Subsequent subtasks (per-page authoring; the
foundation-edit subtask for `configuration.rst:254`) will draw down the
6 residuals as a side-effect of doing their primary work. Each
foundation-page landing must be paired with the deletion of the
corresponding `nitpick_ignore` entries per the §4.2 mapping.
