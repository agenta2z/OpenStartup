"""Smoke tests for the orchestrator's resiliency guarantees.

These tests MOCK the inferencer so they run without any real LLM cost or
network access. They verify:
1. The handler-emit-follow-ups loop works (constant monitoring).
2. The safety re-enqueue fires when the inferencer crashes.
3. Idempotency: re-enqueueing the same task while in-flight is a no-op.

Run:

# ─── Catastrophe-prevention tests (revised 2026-05-20 — min-gap floor model) ─
# Earlier design used 3 count-based defenses (rapid-window breaker, per-task
# lifetime cap, global lifetime cap → shutdown). That worked but was too brittle:
# transient infra outages (Jira down >3h) would exhaust the budget and need a
# human restart. Replaced with a single time-based defense: unlimited
# re-enqueues, but a MINIMUM 5-min gap on every crash-path re-enqueue. This is
# self-healing AND bounds dir-creation rate to ≤ 288/day per task.
#
# Hard backstop: RunWorkspace.G-3 (1000 disk dirs → quarantine) is still in
# place for any edge case that bypasses the gap floor.
