"""Real-CLI integration test for ``/role_setup``.

Spawns ``python -m openteam.server.resources.tools.role_setup`` as a real
subprocess to validate the FULL CLI module code path end-to-end. Mirrors
``create_role/test_create_role_real_cli.py`` and ``task/test_task_real_cli.py``.

Exercises:
  * CLI argument parsing via ``cli.py``'s argparse
  * Underscore-canonical normalization (Option D fix)
  * YAML loading via ``load_config + instantiate`` (nested outer + inner BTA)
  * LazyConfigFactory worker spawning at BOTH outer and inner BTA layers
  * Per-skill nested-BTA isolation (each outer worker is its own BTA instance)
  * Workspace allocator (``_runtime/tasks/role_setup/<TS>_<UUID>/``)
  * Real subprocess stdout/stderr capture
  * Exit code propagation
  * Canonical deliverable surfacing via ``outputs/final_deliverables/``

Cost gate: SKIPPED unless ``acli`` available on PATH AND RovoChat credentials
are set (``ROVOCHAT_EMAIL`` / ``ROVOCHAT_API_TOKEN``, or mappable from
``JIRA_EMAIL`` / ``JIRA_API_TOKEN``).

Runtime: ~15-30 min, ~$1-3 (nested BTA = more facets total than create_role).
