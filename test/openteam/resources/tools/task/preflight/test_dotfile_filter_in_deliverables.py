"""Preflight tests for dotfile filtering in ``_list_deliverable_files``.

Validates the dotfile-filter that prevents hidden marker/metadata files
(``.DS_Store``, ``.gitkeep``, editor droppings, etc.) from being surfaced as
user-facing deliverables.

Part 2 (two-axis model): deliverables live directly in ``outputs/`` — the
``final_deliverables/`` subfolder and the ``.self_promoted`` self-promotion
marker are retired. The dotfile filter still applies: any hidden file under a
child's ``outputs/`` must be excluded from the collected/aggregated deliverable
set so it never pollutes the surfacing chain.

Fix location:
  CoreProjects/AgentFoundation/src/agent_foundation/common/inferencers/
  deliverable_boundary.py — ``_list_deliverable_files`` operates on
  ``workspace.outputs_dir`` and skips names starting with ``.``.
