"""Preflight tests for the `--plan` mode YAML swap (executor.py).

Background
----------
The full topology `breakdown-multiflow-plan-then-implement.yaml` wraps PTI in
an outer Dual that reviews the implementation deliverable. When `--plan` is
selected and the implementation is disabled, PTI returns "" (empty string),
causing the outer Dual to review an empty deliverable using
`template_root_space=implementation` review criteria. This wastes iterations
and applies the wrong review semantics.

Fix
---
When `mode == "plan"` AND the source YAML is the full PTI topology, the
executor swaps the source to the standalone `breakdown-multiflow-plan.yaml`
(which has its OWN outer Dual reviewing the PLAN itself with the correct
`_template_root_space=plan` criteria). The full PTI topology imports the
same standalone YAML via `_import_:`, so there's no drift risk.

These tests guard the swap logic in `executor._run_topology`.
