"""Preflight test: verify the YAML's explicit workspace block enables
`use_final_deliverables_folder=True`.

Why this matters
----------------
Without this flag, the BTA at line ~977 in `breakdown_then_aggregate_inferencer.py`
falls back to writing copied worker deliverables directly into `outputs/`,
intermixed with intermediate streaming logs and the final consolidated
output.md. With the flag enabled, the BTA writes them to
`outputs/final_deliverables/` (a distinct subdirectory) which gives a clear
"this is the user-facing deliverable" boundary.

The YAML used to pass `workspace_root: "/tmp/topo_b_ws"` (a string shorthand
that the Dual class auto-converts to `InferencerWorkspace(root=...)` with
default flags). We replaced that with an explicit
`workspace: {_target_: InferencerWorkspace, root: ..., use_final_deliverables_folder: true}`
block so the flag is plumbed through.

This preflight catches a silent regression where someone reverts to the
shorthand form (which would still load OK but lose the deliverables/
separation).
